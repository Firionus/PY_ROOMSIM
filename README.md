A simulation of the acoustics of a simple rectangular prism room has been constructed using the MATLAB m-code programming language. The aim in creating the program Roomsim was to provide a signal generation tool for the speech and hearing research community, and a teaching tool for illustrating the image method of simulating room acoustics and some acoustical effects. The program is menu driven, has a user guide and example data files, and will be made freely available over the Internet under a GNU General Public Licence.
